# SuperKindGame
Wack-a-mole style class project project game. Written in Java using a library called Spritely.

This Game was created in CSC305 at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
The course was taught by Professor Bill Foote.
It uses his Java libraries [Testy](https://testy.jovial.com) for unit testing, and [Spritely](https://spritely.jovial.com) for the graphics.
The given code is inside the "others" package. It includes an observer pattern for "monitors" that can view the game.
All code I designed is inside the "superkind package."

To launch the program, you pass a number of arguments to the run script. See the help message, which is partly generated by the provided superkind.SuperKindGameLauncher class. Running with "test" runs the unit tests. To run a game lasting 40 seconds with one monitor, and a second game lasting 60 seconds with two monitors, you can use these argument:

./run.sh sk: 40 mon_1 sk: 60 mon_2 mon_3

In this game, the user first sees a 6x5 grid of L.A. Metro logos. The game lasts the number of seconds given on the command line. For the first 5% of the game time, the screen doesn't change. Then, for the next 90%, each square has Rude Dude appear in it. Rude Dude appears exactly once in each square during this time, at a random time. During the last 5% of the time, Rude Dude does not appear; by then, he will have appeared in each square once.

The user clicks on a square containing Rude Dude to replace him with Super Kind. Clicking on a square that does not contain Rude Dude has no effect.

The object of the game is to prevent Rude Dude from occupying more than five squares. If Rude Dude appears in a sixth squared, the game immediately ends in a loss. If the game ends with Rude Dude in five or fewer squares, the game ends as a win.

The game makes use of the "Model View Controller" design pattern as well as the observer pattern.
